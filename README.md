# Bio152
## Welcome to Dr. Meyer's "biology-is-awesome" website 
Hello class,

_This is Fall 2020 Bio152._ I am your instructor, Dr. Rekha Meyer

Bio152 provides an introductory lab experience to biology and non-biology majors. Students are introduced to Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) with a model organism such as C. elegans. Students learn how to use the scientific method to construct hypothesis, set up experiments and controls, record results, analyze data and make conclusions. Basic laboratory techniques and safety are stressed. This lab course may be taken concurrently or separately by students taking BIO 0141 Principles of Biology.
